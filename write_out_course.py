        lecture_1.2.md
        lecture_1.3.md
        lecture_1.4.md

Calls the SCORM packaging script to create a SCORM package for each lecture.

Also writes out all copy for easy (manual) upload to Moodle (note that ideally we could package all this material
so that OU could automate the upload to Moodle).
